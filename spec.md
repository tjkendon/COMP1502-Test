# Test

This is a very simple test to ensure that you can get code, add code and share it back with me.

## Download

Download the skeleton code that I provided. Load it into your BlueJ and compile and run it to see if it works correctly.

## Modify

Add getters and setters for x and y in the code and a toString method.

## ReUpload

Push your code into your resposity are submit a pull request for me to take a look at your code. 
Once I've received your request and looked at your code we're good to go.
